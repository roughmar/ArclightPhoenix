## Sideboard Pieces
(Still being worked)

#### Counterspells
- Negate
There's not much to say about this card, other than you need to understand that even though it is a hard counter, 2 mana for a conditional hard counter in pioneer is something you need to think about carefully.

There's some matchups where it's inclusion is a no brainer (like UW control), since it has a lot of targets you want to shutdown. The issue comes with matches where the density of non creature spells isn't that high, and you still want to counter them, if possible.
>If you are against a [Collected Company](https://scryfall.com/card/dtk/177/collected-company) you probably want to counter it, but do you really want to bring a Negate into a deck that's almost entirely composed of creatures?
>How often will it get stuck in your hand? How often will you leave 2 mana up _all the time_ so that your Negate is online?
