The first two examples will have the ideas I'd try to convey to someone first playing the deck. The other examples further down the lane will be a quick thought process over the ideas discussed in the primer.

## Standard Examples

![Hand 1](assets/img/hand1.png)
Classic hand that needs to be shipped but might seem ok at first.
You have a Phoenix in hand, but there's a way to bin it.
The mana base has an awkward sequencing, but its manageable.
You have absolutely no agency with this, however.

Let's quickly think through our first turns:

Assuming we're on the play, we play the tapped land, pass. On the next turn we get 1 extra card, play Spirebluff, and we have the following options
- kill whatever creature they played with a removal that might be necessary later on and enter topdeck mode
- pass and enter topdeck mode


when will you realistically cast Treasure Cruise? Are you thinking of binning the Phoenix to Axe or the redundant cruise?

What about the argument of "just sandbagging it out and forking the Lightning Axe on 2 creatures opponent plays and bring back the phoenix?"
That argument is advocating for a turn 4 play, where you completely tap out, and are banking in top decking either a perfect sequence of 2 land drops and a cantrip, without having any kind of control over it. The exact opposite of what you want to do.

If you think over it, this hand is a pseudo mulligan to 4, and a really bad one at it.

If we're on the draw, the hand still has to be shipped. You get to see an extra card, but not having any kind of control over what is coming, or being able to shape out your hand, is a recipe for scooping when the lands don't come, or the cantrips don't appear.

I can't think of a single matchup where I'd keep this hand.

Although it looks extremely similar to the first hand, this is a keep.
You still have the Phoenix/Axe combo, and the Delve card, but this time you are no longer dependant on your oponent, and are actually able to create a proactive plan with both Ledger Shredder and Picklock Prankster.

The reasons are sort of nuanced, but hopefully they'll make sense.

You have a way to remove a high priority threat with Axe (just like the previous case), but you also have a way to send it away, in case it's a match where it has no relevance with connive triggers.
Although there's no Air ready, you can prepare it with Free the Fae.

Bear in mind, however, that this is a hand that can still go sort of wrong, but you still have some agency in the game if that happens.

How can this go wrong?

- Opponent counters your Free the Fae. You still have Shredder, but no way to trigger connive and keep weaving cards. You're on topdeck mode.
- Free the Fae only sees removal. You're still sort of ok in this situation, as Cruise is closer to being online (3 cards in the grave +2 from potential Lightning Axe), but you are banking on being able to use the removal, else it's topdeck mode.
- You're Thoughtseized and they Fatal Push the Ledger Shredder. Still not horrible, depends on what they Thoughtseized. If they take the Treasure Cruise, there's still game. If they take the Picklock, you're kinda banking on topdeck mode, but can potentially rebuild with Treasure Cruise.

How can this go right?

- First 2 draws are Land/Cantrip in no particular order. Game is absolutely on.



#### Sequencing Alert
#### Lands
Thinking through our first turns, the land sequencing is actually important here and can send signals to your opponent.
If you play Spirebluff on turn 1, and don't draw an untapped land, you will be forced to shock the Steam Vents to either cast Ledger Shredder, or go for Free the Fae.
If the choice turns out to be Free the Fae at the opponent's end step, you are signaling that you are potentially going to cast something 1 entire turn rotation ahead of time.

The usual choice would be to play Steam Vents on turn 1, play Spirebluff turn 2, and leave the opponent in the dark about your intentions.

However, you might want to force mental games in this situation, especially with a hand that isn't that fast, as is the case of this one.
You can shock the Steam Vents on turn 1 to represent something. If the opponent drops a creature and you don't kill it, and then passes the turn and you don't cantrip, you just manifested a Spell Pierce in their head that doesn't exist.

#### Spells
Assuming you get the best case scenario of Land/Cantrip discussed previously, you are now actually playing the deck.
There's some options to consider for turn 2:
- cantrip (assuming that was our draw) to make sure we get the 3rd land
- play the Shredder, so next turn we can connive and start growing it
- play Free the Fae on our turn
- play Free the Fae on opponent's turn

The highest risk/reward option is the shredder. If it doesn't get removed on sight, we can start having a growing threat while filling the grave.
We'll be able to keep rolling in spells and be proactive.
Notice that you are able to connive both in your turn and attack for 2, or wait for theirs, effectively representing a range of possibilities from your hand to your opponent for the measly cost of 1 damage.

Free the Fae on our turn only makes sense if there's a potential for counterspells. Casting Free the Fae and getting a Thoughtseize after is a recipe to tilt (not that you wouldn't get Thoughseize'd anyway, but at least your opponent won't know you are tapped out, and you can make an informed decision if he still goes for it).

Free the Fae on opponent's endstep is perfectly fine, but you need to be able to justify it if the play next turn will be Shredder into cantrip anyway (since you won't be able to attack, and you just tapped out on your turn so you can connive).

Cantrip to get the 3rd land is the most conservative option, but the one that hinders your plan the most.
You are not presenting a threat on the board and you are not advancing your plan.
