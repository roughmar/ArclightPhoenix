## Standard Examples

![Hand 1](assets/img/hand1.png)
Classic hand that needs to be shipped.
Despite having a Phoenix and a way to bin it, you are completely dependant on your oponent playing a creature worthy of a lightning axe. There's 2 delve cards in hand and no air.
You have absolutely no agency with this.

Although it looks extremely similar to the first hand, this is a keep.
You still have the Phoenix/Axe combo, and the Delve card, but this time you are no longer dependant on your oponent, and are actually able to create a proactive plan with both Ledger Shredder and Picklock Prankster.
